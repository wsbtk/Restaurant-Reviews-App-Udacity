# Restaurant Reviews App
---
## Project Overview

For the **Restaurant Reviews** project, I incrementally converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. I took a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the users.

### Specification

I was provided the starter code for the restaurant reviews website. The code had a lot of issues. It was barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also didn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it didn’t work offline at all. My job was to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality.

### How to run the Project?

1. Download or clone this repository in your local storage.

    * In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
   * Note -  For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as `python` by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter `python -m http.server 8000`.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`. The site should be running.
